# Objective: 
The objective was to define a project that would showcase the teams’ electrical and computer engineering skillsets, by targeting a key issue which incorporated the use of analog, digital and programming. 

The team, identified a problem in a household and industrial setting in which one’s mobility, precision and perseverance is limited by one’s human potential. A robot can outperform and outmaneuver a human. Our goal was to build an autonomous robotic hand that pivots, maneuvers, grasps and transports obstacles. The robotic hand could be used in kitchens, or industrial environments. 

# Responsibilities: 
## Temesgen Gebregziabher: 
Project Leader: Responsibilities include designing the arm with Solidworks software. Researching power requirements of modules. Researching 3D materials to use, and also the control system of the project.
## Malcolm Carter:
Design Engineer: Responsibilities include researching and defining the engineering requirements of the system.  Understanding and defining torque requirements for servos. 
## Yi Si:
Hardware Engineer: Responsibilities include in depth research into researching the power requirements and prototyping the sensory system to be used as an input signal
## Robert Mwaniki:
Software Engineer: Responsibilities include collecting information, confirming accuracy in documentation of calculations, and presenting conducted data in cohesive manner.

Our goal was to build the skeletal architecture of the arm. In doing so, we cut acryllic pieces, to build the aesthetic structure. Thereafter, used a 3D Printer to design the brackets that would go between the arm pieces, for structural integrity. Lasty, designed and 3D printed an arm to pick up objects.
