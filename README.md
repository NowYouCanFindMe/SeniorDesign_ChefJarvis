# Objective: 
The objective is to define a project that will showcase the teams’ electrical and computer engineering skillsets, by targeting a key issue which incorporates the use of analog, digital and programming. 

The team, has identified a problem in a household and industrial setting in which one’s mobility, precision and perseverance is limited by one’s human potential. A robot can outperform and outmaneuver a human. Our goal is to build an autonomous robotic hand that pivots, maneuvers, grasps and transports obstacles. The robotic hand could be used in kitchens, or industrial environments. 


# Materials and Methods:
Arduino Uno + Xbee
Actuators, 
Brackets, 
Bearings,
 Fasteners, Nuts, Washers, Hex Key, 
Switches
Power Supply,

PLC Filament
Use of a 3D Printer

And other non-essentials


Our goal is to build the skeletal architecture of the arm. Once completed, we will use a 3D printer to building the aesthetic molding. 

# Results:
The robotic hand will be mobile, autonomous, and versatile for any environment.
